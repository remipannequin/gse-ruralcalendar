# gse-ruralcalendar
Gnome Shell extension that display the date in the French Republican Calendar, and the plant, animal or agricultural tool associated to this day.

# Context and motivation
The [French Republican Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar) was a calendar created during the french revolution
as an alternative to the gregorian calendar. It has twelve months which were given new names based on nature, and alse each day was associated with a plant
(tree, root, flower, fruits, ...) a common animal or agricultural tool.

This extension display the date (day - month) and the "name" of the day. When clicked, a popup appears that show the 
wikipedia summary for this plant, animal or tool.

It enable to learn about plants, and create a closeness to nature and the current season.

# Limitations
The name of the month are hard to translate, and sound best in french. They might also be understandable in other roman languages. 

# Customization
Currently only the French Republican Calendar is supported, but any kind of alternative calendar could be used. Changing the name of the days (and wikipedia title)
can be done by changing the json data file.
